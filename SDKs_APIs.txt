The Employee Happiness/Satisfaction Index Web Application may use a variety of SDKs (Software Development Kits), APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), assets, and libraries to support its functionality and enhance its capabilities. Some examples of these resources may include:

JDK (Java Development Kit) : Is a software development kit that provides the tools and resources necessary for developing and compiling Java applications. It includes a set of command-line tools, libraries, and documentation for writing, testing, and debugging Java applications.

npm (Node Package Manager) : Is a command-line tool used to install, manage, and share packages (i.e., libraries, frameworks, and tools) for Node.js applications. It provides access to a large repository of open-source packages, including many packages that are commonly used in web development.

Angular Material: A UI component library for Angular that provides pre-built UI components such as buttons, forms, and dialog boxes.

ng2charts : Is an open-source charting library for Angular, which provides a simple way to create various charts and graphs, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more.
