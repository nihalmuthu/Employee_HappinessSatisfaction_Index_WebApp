The Employee Happiness/Satisfaction Index Web Application is a tool that prompts employees to answer a series of questions through a user interface built using Angular, and generates relevant reports to showcase the employee happiness/satisfaction index using a SpringBoot back-end. The reports provide insights into factors that impact employee well-being, such as work-life balance, team dynamics, and management style, and can be customized to highlight specific trends or patterns. The application is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use, making it a powerful tool for organizations to improve employee satisfaction and productivity.
